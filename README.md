The report creates a simple graph.
In Power BI Desktop the bars have the right colors (left to right: red, gold, red, gray, red) but when published to powerbi.com the colors of the bars are wrong.
I'm not sure if this is a R issue (the order of the colors are not guaranteed) or if the service is not repsecting the order of the colors.
